# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction API

##  Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end **Heart Disease Risk Prediction System** using machine learning.  
Given a patient’s clinical attributes (age, cholesterol, chest pain type, blood pressure, etc.), the model predicts:

- **0 → Low risk (no heart disease)**
- **1 → High risk (heart disease present)**

The final model is deployed as a **Flask-based REST API**, containerized with **Docker**, and trained using the **Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset**.


## Problem Statement

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection helps prevent severe outcomes and reduces healthcare burdens.

**Goal**: Build a model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on basic health measurements.
